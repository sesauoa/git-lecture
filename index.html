                            <br>
                            <small>
                                    This is horrible! Imagine the hundreds of folders to manage.<br>
                                    It only leads to confusion of where bugs were introduced and a bloated project folder.<br>
                                    What if you couldn't find where you went wrong and had to redo half of the project?

                                    Changes made to files are stored as differences between versions.<br>
                                    When you've made a change to a file(s), save the difference it into the VCS.

                                    More than likely, the programme has changed significantly and is now incompatible with the customer's system.<br>
                                    The 'bug' could have been built into a new feature or is a dependency in something new.

                                With version control you could find the bug, go back and fix it then deploy the changes to the customer.<br>

                            Committing is like taking a snapshot of the code

                                    In the Version Control section, I discussed creating new folders to keep track of versions. <br>
                                    Committing is more or less the equivalent, but a much cleaner solution.

                            The commit message is used to document changes
                            <br>

                                    <code>git commit -am 'made some really cool changes'</code><br>
                                    The option <code>-am 'msg'</code> is a shortcut to add all tracked files and write a commit message in line before committing.

                            Branches are different versions of a repo
                            <br>
                            <small>
                                    By default a repo is on the <code>master</code> branch, this ideally should be the stable build of the project.<br>
                                    When we're developing something, we're going to break it. Having a safe space to do this is what branches provide.<br>

                                    Once we've finished with out changes to the <code>feature/hello-nasser</code> branch, we'll want to propogate those changes to the main branch.<br>
                                    To do this, we checkout the <code>master</code> branch then merge changes from the <code>feature/hello-nasser</code> branch.<br>
                                    <code>git checkout master</code><br>
                                    <code>git merge feature/hello-nasser</code>

                                    If two people change the same lines of one file, the merge algorithm <code>git</code> uses isn't smart enough to tell which branch contains the correct changes.
                                    The responsibility falls to you to sort out the conflict.
